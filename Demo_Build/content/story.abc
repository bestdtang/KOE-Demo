        [SeedTrader]
        They say that it was the alchemist that was responsible for the curse. First of all, it wasn't a curse. It's merely an experiment gone wrong. We were trying to transform the smell of the stinky plant into something enjoyable. But instead, it went wrong. [EOA]
        
        Luke picks up the bottle with the stinky plant sealed within, and stares into it.
        
        [SeedTrader]
        The failed potion accidentally went into the soil and contaminated the land. That's how the stench got to everyone. [EOA]
        
        He sighs and puts down the bottle.
        
        [SeedTrader]
        But that wasn't all. I wasn't thinking properly. I knew that the townsfolk will be angry at us, and I was afraid.

I thought that would make me feel safer from the anger of these people. [EOA]

        [SeedTrader]
        Anyways, the forest is a maze. If you make the wrong turn, you'll get lost. This is where the leading flower comes in to play. [EOA]
        
        He holds up the flower.
        
        [SeedTrader]
        This flower tells directions. As long as you give it a clear destination, it will lead you to it accurately and timely. Here, hold these two for me, will you? [EOA]

		I've been also researching on how to get rid of this mess. It seems like besides the Citrine, you would also need this seed to make the antidote. [EOA]

		[SeedTrader]
		This is the Eureka seed. Take it with you. You'll need it. [EOA]

		The day is not young. You must go before the sandstorm comes and catch you again. Or if you want to, you can stay here for a while to wait for the storm to leave. [EOA]

@Alchemist Performs At the Cauldron And Fails

		[Alchemist]
		Alright, ingredients, check. Solvent,
		check. Ok. Let's see if this works. [EOA]

		The alchemist walks into the pond in the middle, towards the
		floating citrine at the center. She takes out a vial and puts
		it under the gemstone.
		
		//(SE: Miracles sounds)
		[MiracleSound01]
		Miraculously, from the gemstone comes out a drop of a glowing
		substance. It's so bright that it could almost be a star in
		the night.
		Berette walks back to the cauldron, and adds in the drop of
		citrine.
		
		//(SE: Miracle sounds)
		[MiracleSound02]

		The pot starts to glow. A golden color emits from the
		cauldron.
		
		//(SE: Explosion)
		[Explosion]

		Suddenly, the contents of the pot explodes into Berette's
		face. 
				
		Berette slowly finds herself a chair, then sits down
		and cries.

		[Alchemist]
		I don't know! Why? I thought I had it all solved. I was supposed to be
		ready when someone arrives. What
		ingredient am I missing? [EOA] [Action]

	*reprompt 
		Berette extracts a magical substance from the
		citrine in the middle, and adds it into the cauldron she is
		working on. But the content explodes and Berette's experiment
		has failed again. Disappointed and depressed, she asks what
		ingredient she is missing. Perhaps your seed may help?

		[Alchemist]
		This, my friend, is a Glimmerbrook
		Mandrake. You don't find this
		anywhere. It is nearly impossible

		[Alchemist]
		Oh, yes. This seed, it's called the
		Glimmerbrook Mandrake. You don't come
		across this seed like you breathe
		air. It's basically as precious as the

		Judging by its rarity, and the fact

		[Alchemist]
		After all this time, huh? [EOA]
		
		[BAR_SIGH]
		She quietly sits down on a chair.


		[Alchemist]
		You know, you we used to be partners.
		Luke and I. Together, we've
		accomplished many things that no

		He was a dear friend. [EOA]

		Barette then smiles a bit. She looks down on the ground.

		[Alchemist]
		Our first successful experiment was with a rose. We were trying to make it transparent. We had the radio on that day, and it just so happened that when we did it, the guy in the radio yelled out Eureka! as well. perfect timing.
		So, that became the phrase we'd cheer whenever
		we accomplished something together. [EOA]

		[Alchemist]

		[Alchemist]
		Given the rarity of this seed... this
